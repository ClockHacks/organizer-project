A ClockHacks project made by the organizers in just 3 hours

Idea: base ten clock
365 days in a year\

year = jeffrey
day = Nathan

3600 * 24 = 86400
therefore, 86400 seconds in a day
1 day = 1 nathan
therefore,
1 nathan = 86400 seconds
1 nathan = 10 seans
10 seans = 86400 seconds
1 sean = 8640 seconds
1 sean = 100 cera 
100 cera = 8640 seconds
1 cera = 86.4 seconds
1 cera = 100 jays
100 jay = 84.6 seconds
1 jay = 0.864 seconds

therefore,
1 nathan = 86400 seconds -> day
1 sean = 8640 seconds -> hour
1 cera = 86.4 seconds -> minute
1 jay = 0.864 seconds -> second
